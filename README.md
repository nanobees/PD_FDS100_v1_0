Low Noise Photodetector Circuit Based on Thorlab's FDS100 Photodiode

This circuit is done for testing the exact wavelength of the commercial lasers we use in our lab. The commercial
photodetectors that used in our spectroscopy system is not appropriate for using with lasers so we use a Thorlabs 
FDS100 photodetector for this application. Circuit is based on the design that recommended in Thorlabs's website.
This circuit needs further testing(actually not working for mysterious reasons.) please contact me if you want to 
use this design; haltugyildirim_at_protonmail.com
